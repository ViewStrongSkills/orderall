    <p>
      Orderall is a web app that allows users to view restaurants,
      choose from their menus and order. Users can search for restaurants near
      them, view the business’s location, menu and other attributes. They can
      then choose items from the menu and complete their order. The order will
      be sent to you via automated phone call where you can either accept or
      decline it. If you accept, they will be notified and you can begin
      preparing their order before they arrive, reducing congestion. Orderall
      currently doesn’t handle any sort of payment or delivery. Please note that
      since Orderall is very new you’ll likely run into some bugs when using it.

    <h2>Why partner with Orderall?</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      Orderall is free.  That means that for a bit of time spent setting up your
      page you can increase the number of people looking at your business. The
      number of people checking out your business will increase as Orderall
      grows, since the more businesses join the more attractive it becomes to
      consumers. Since Orderall is so new, some of it is still being developed.
      This means that if you sign up, you'll have the ability to influence the
      design decisions of the app.

      <h2>How to get your business on
      Orderall</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      There’s a relatively simple procedure to setting up your business on
      Orderall. Click on the Business Signup button. Add in your name, email,
      password, business name and upload some evidence that you own or manage
      the business. You will receive an email notifying you when your
      application has been processed. Then, you can click on your name, then
      “Add my Business”. Fill out that form and you’ll be able to see your
      business. From there, you can choose to add menus and items. Feel free to
      add a link to your Orderall page in your website, Facebook page or
      anything else. Email us at <a href="mailto:contact@orderall.io">
      contact@orderall.io</a> and we’ll send through any
      icons or graphics related to Orderall that you’d like. This information
      can also be found on the <a href="{{URL::to('/business-guide')}}">business
      guide</a>, and other information for partnering can be found on <a
      href="{{URL::to('/partner')}}">the partner page</a>. Don’t forget, you can
      always contact us about any issues and we’ll be happy to help.

      <h2>Requirements</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Orderall has been designed to have minimum requirements for businesses.
    All that’s needed is a landline phone to accept orders and any device (such
    as a phone, tablet or computer) that can access the internet so that you can
    set up your page. You’ll also need an email account so that we can send you
    a verification email when you get set up with Orderall</p>
    <div class="page-head-content">
      <h2>Pricing</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Since Orderall is extremely new, it’s completely free on both ends (user
    and business) so that it can grow faster. We will probably introduce
    advertising into the platform, and once it is grown enough we’ll introduce
    the ability to pay directly before picking up the food. Here, we’ll take a
    small portion of the total (less than 5%, in contrast to delivery apps which
    take up to 35%). However, this will always be completely optional for
    businesses and if you sign up for free, Orderall will stay free.</p>
